| Booking drawer | View booking details, update status, checkout |
| New booking flow | 4 steps: client search/create → service → time slots → confirm |

| Settings — Business | Business info save |
| Settings — Services | CRUD (add/toggle/delete) |
| Settings — Hours | Per-day open/closed toggles + time pickers; saves to `business_hours` JSONB |
| Add-ons page | Shows WhatsApp + Stripe cards, contact CTA |
| Profile page | Password change |
| Toast notifications | Success/error toasts wired to AppShell |
| Loading skeletons | Per-page skeleton components |
| PWA manifest | Installable on mobile |
| Multi-tenant RLS | All queries scoped to `business_id` |
| Email confirmations | `/api/send-confirmation` route via Resend — auth-protected, HTML-escaped |
| Onboarding flow | Settings detects no business row, shows setup form |

### Pending manual steps
| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| ~~**Supabase migration**~~ | ✅ Done Jun 10 2026 — `business_hours` JSONB column added to businesses table |
| **Resend domain verification** | Add bapita.com to resend.com → get DNS records → add to domain registrar. Sender: `noreply@bapita.com` |

### Not done / next priorities
| Item | Priority |
|---|---|
| Public booking page per client | High — customer-facing booking page, needed for demo |
| Blocked dates (Settings → Blocked dates tab) | Medium |
| Stripe payment collection | Low — add-on |
| WhatsApp automation | Low — add-on |
| Google Calendar sync | Low — nice-to-have |
| Test with real data / first client | High |

  "tuesday":   {"open": true,  "start": "09:00", "end": "19:00"},
