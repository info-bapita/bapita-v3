const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Do I need to know anything technical to use Bapita?",
    a: "No. That's the point. We handle all the setup, configuration, and maintenance. You tell us about your business, we build the tool, and you use it — no logins to a complicated dashboard, no settings to figure out.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is Bapita different from using Calendly, Buffer, or other tools directly?",
    a: "Those tools are built for people who want to configure software. Bapita is built for people who want the outcome without the configuration. We set everything up to match your business, connect your accounts, write your copy, and keep it running. As the suite grows, you get more tools that share the same approach — pick only the ones you need.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does '48 hours' actually mean for Bapita Book?",
    a: "Once you book a free call and we agree on the setup, your booking page and owner dashboard are live within 48 business hours. That includes the page design, your service menu, availability settings, and WhatsApp/SMS reminders.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use just one tool without committing to the whole suite?",
    a: "Yes. Each product is priced and managed independently. Start with Book if that's your biggest pain point. Add Social when you're ready. There's no forced bundle.",
  },
  {
    q: "When will the other tools (Social, SEO, Outreach, Bots) launch?",
    a: "Book is live today. Social is in active development and launches next. SEO, Outreach, and Bots are on the roadmap after that. The best way to get early access — and a founding-customer price — is to join the notify list for each product on this page.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data safe? What happens to my client information?",
    a: "Your booking data, client details, and business information are stored securely and never sold or shared with third parties. Each product runs on infrastructure that meets standard data protection requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I want to cancel?",
    a: "Cancel any time, per product. There are no annual lock-ins unless you've explicitly chosen an annual plan for a discount. If you cancel Bapita Book, your booking page stays live through the end of your billing period.",
  },
