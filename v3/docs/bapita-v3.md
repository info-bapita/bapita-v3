# Bapita v3 — Multi-Product Platform Strategy
**Positioning · Product Architecture · Visual Identity · Go-To-Market**
*June 2026 — From single-product agency to multi-product SaaS platform*

---

> ## ⚠️ v3.1 Reality & Direction Update (June 29, 2026)
>
> This document is the **vision / north star**. The parts below were written aspirationally;
> the real near-term plan is narrower. Read this banner first — where it conflicts with the body,
> the banner wins.
>
> **Reality:**
> - **0 paying customers.** Book is *built and usable* but has **no paying users** (the §2 table
>   saying "mature, paying customers" is aspirational — Book is "live/usable, 0 paying").
> - **Solo founder, ~2–3 month runway.** No team for 5 products.
> - **Reachable markets: Israel + Turkey SMBs**, sold by hand in Hebrew/Turkish. Product UI is
>   English-first, but the *sale* is local-language.
>
> **Focus decision — build 2, waitlist 3, sell by hand:**
> - **Real now:** Book (live) + Social (finishing to production).
> - **Waitlist only:** SEO, Outreach, Bots — hub card + "Get notified," no build until demand.
> - **GTM:** founder-led / done-with-you sales first (not self-serve). Self-serve is the
>   *delivery*, not the acquisition engine. See `docs/bapita-v3-gtm.md`.
>
> **Brand/design direction change (supersedes §3–§6 specifics):**
> - The brand is now **two layers**: a **neutral premium DARK** master hub (`bapita.com`,
>   near-black) + **light, colorful product worlds** per subdomain. The warm terracotta is **no
>   longer the master color — it's Book's color.**
> - **One structural design system + 5 skins.** Each product = accent color + icon **motif** +
>   one hero illustration. **No bespoke mascots / per-product layouts** (dropped as unmaintainable
>   solo). The "unique vibe / illustration style / typography mood" idea in §3 is shelved.
> - New product color wheel: **Book orange `#D4622A`, Social emerald `#1FA971`, SEO azure
>   `#2D6CF0`, Outreach violet `#7C5CFC`, Bots magenta `#E0457B`** (replaces the old
>   terracotta/amber/forest/teal/indigo map — which was also mis-wired in code).
> - **Source of truth for all design is now `docs/brand/bapita-v3-brand-system.md`.**

## 1. Strategic Pivot

### From v2 (Current)
- Single product: Booking platform
- Target: Israeli barbers, salons & appointment businesses
- Model: Done-for-you agency (build in 48h, manage monthly)
- Market: Israel only
- Positioning: "Built for you. Runs without you."

### To v3 (New)
- Multi-product: Family of 5 digital tools for SMBs
- Target: SMBs globally (Shopify stores, agencies, freelancers, clinics, barbers)
- Model: Self-serve SaaS per product, separate subscriptions
- Market: Global (English-first, Hebrew later)
- Positioning: "Tools that run your business online. Pick yours."

### Why
- Expand TAM beyond Israeli appointment businesses
- Each product serves a distinct need with its own market
- Products reinforce each other (cross-sell across the suite)
- SaaS model scales better than agency model
- Brand name "Bapita" is strong enough to carry a suite

### What Changes
| Aspect | v2 | v3 |
|--------|----|----|
| Products | 1 (Booking) | 5 (Book, Social, SEO, Outreach, Bots) |
| Target | Israeli barbers/salons | Global SMBs |
| Model | Agency (done-for-you) | SaaS (self-serve + setup) |
| Pricing | ₪200-1,690/mo | $X/mo per product |
| Language | Hebrew-first | English-first |
| bapita.com | Booking LP | Master brand product hub |
| Book.bapita.com | — (was bapita.com) | Dedicated booking LP |

### What Stays
- Brand palette (terra cotta, cream, amber, warm charcoal)
- Heebo typography
- Voice (direct, warm, peer-to-peer)
- Visual language (editorial, warm, premium)

## 2. Product Architecture

### Subdomain Structure

```
bapita.com              → Master brand page (product hub)
├── book.bapita.com     → Appointment booking platform
├── social.bapita.com   → Social media management
├── seo.bapita.com      → SEO tools suite
├── outreach.bapita.com → Link building & outreach
└── bots.bapita.com     → AI chatbots (WhatsApp, Telegram)
```

### Product Maturity

| Product | Status | Priority | Team |
|---------|--------|----------|------|
| Book | ✅ Live/usable, **0 paying customers** | 1 - First revenue target | Solo |
| Social | 🚧 In development (under construction on social-ops-platform) | 2 - Next launch | Current |
| SEO | 📋 Planned | 3 | — |
| Outreach | 📋 Planned | 4 | — |
| Bots | 💡 Concept | 5 (earliest) | — |

### Each Product Is
- **Independent** — separate subdomain, separate subscription, separate dashboard
- **Self-serve** — sign up, pay, use. No 48h build.
- **Different visual identity** — own accent colour, own sub-brand feel, but same brand family
- **Cross-sell opportunity** — dashboard shows companion products, works best together

### Pricing Model (per product)
- Monthly subscription per product ($X/mo)
- No lock-in, cancel anytime
- Annual discounts available (2 months free)
- Each product may have tiers (e.g., Book: Starter / Pro / Agency)

## 3. Visual Identity System

### Master Brand Palette (inherited from v2, unchanged)

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary (terra cotta) | `#D4622A` | Logo, primary buttons, book.bapita.com brand |
| Accent (amber) | `#E8920A` | social.bapita.com brand, secondary CTAs, highlights |
| Dark (warm charcoal) | `#1C1917` | Headline text, footer backgrounds |
| Text body | `#2D2821` | Body copy |
| Text muted | `#6B6052` | Secondary text, labels |
| Background (cream) | `#F8F4EE` | Page background |
| Background (sand) | `#FDF0E4` | Wash backgrounds, gradient bases |
| Background light | `#FBF9F4` | Card surfaces |
| Surface | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, modals, elevated surfaces |
| Border | rgba(30,26,20,0.09) | Dividers, card borders |
| Shadow base | rgba(30,26,20) | All shadow colors (warm, not gray) |

### Gradient Washes
```css
wash-amber:    linear-gradient(to bottom, #FDF0E4, #F8F4EE)
wash-sand:     linear-gradient(to bottom, #F8F4EE, #FBF9F4)
wash-terra:    linear-gradient(135deg, #FDF0E4 0%, #F8F4EE 50%, #FEF0E8 100%)
```

### Per-Product Accent Colours

Each product gets its own accent colour. These sit in the same warm natural family — different shades in the same Mediterranean painting.

| Product | Colour | Hex | Vibe | Usage |
|---------|--------|-----|------|-------|
| **Book** | Terra Cotta | `#D4622A` | Warm, trusted, earthy — the original | Primary buttons, badges, product card icon, subdomain brand |
| **Social** | Amber | `#E8920A` | Energetic, warm, social — conversation starter | Icon accents, badges, status indicators |
| **SEO** | Forest Green | `#3C7A52` | Growth, organic, natural — grounded | Icon, accent badges, data viz highlights |
| **Outreach** | Deep Teal | `#1A7A7A` | Depth, expansion, water — reaching out | Icon, accent, link highlights |
| **Bots** | Slate Indigo | `#5B5F97` | Trustworthy, smart, calm — reliable | Icon, chat bubble accents, status |

Each accent comes with a lighter tint for hover states and backgrounds:
```
Book tint:       #FEF0E8
Social tint:     #FEF5E0
SEO tint:        #EAF3EB
Outreach tint:   #E0F0F0
Bots tint:       #EBECF4
```

### Each Product Gets Its Own Visual "Feel"

This is key. Each product is not just a colour swap — it has its own vibe:

| Product | Feeling | Illustration Style | Typography Mood |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Book | Warm, calm, trusted | Line art with terra-cotta accents | Soft editorial |
| Social | Energetic, bold, playful | Dynamic shapes, amber highlights | Bold, slightly tighter tracking |
| SEO | Grounded, analytical, deep | Organic/natural forms, green | Clean, precise, generous leading |
| Outreach | Expansive, connected, flowing | Water/wave motifs, teal | Open, airy, wide tracking |
| Bots | Sharp, reliable, futuristic | Geometric/clean, indigo | Sleek, modern, monospace touches |

On the master brand page, each product card reflects its own vibe through:
- Its accent colour
- A unique illustration style/icon format
- Typography that hints at its personality
- A one-line tagline that captures its distinct promise

## 8. Copy & Voice

### Master Brand Voice Rules

1. **Speak to SMBs, not just barbers.** Widened from v2. "Your business" not "Your barbershop."
2. **Direct, warm, peer-to-peer.** Same v2 voice. Never "platform," "solution," "leverage."
3. **Short sentences. Max 20 words in headlines.**
4. **Loss-frame when applicable.** "Every hour you spend on social is an hour you don't spend on your business."
5. **Use "you" and "we."** Human relationship, not corporate.
6. **Never mention AI in headlines.** AI is the engine. Human outcomes are the brand.
7. **Safe to say yes.** "Pick what you need. Pay for what you use. No lock-in."

### Master Brand Copyblocks

#### Hero
> **Headline:** Tools that run your business online. Pick yours.
> **Subheadline:** A set of professional digital tools for businesses that want to run better online — without hiring an agency or learning complicated software. Use what you need. Pay for what you use.
> **CTA:** Explore tools

#### Products Section
> **Headline:** Pick your tools
> **Sub:** Every business is different. Choose the tools that fit yours.

#### How It Works
> **Headline:** Three steps. That's it.
> **Step 1 — Pick:** Choose the tools your business needs.
> **Step 2 — Set up:** We help you get started. Connect accounts, add your details.
> **Step 3 — Run:** Your business runs better. You focus on what you do best.

#### Pricing Section
> **Headline:** Each tool is a separate subscription. No lock-in. Cancel anytime.
> **Sub:** Start with one. Add more as you grow.

#### Final CTA
> **Headline:** Ready to run your business better?
> **CTA:** Get started

### Per-Product Taglines

| Product | Tagline |
|---------|---------|
| Book | "Your own booking site. Clients book 24/7. You never touch it." |
| Social | "Schedule, post, and grow your social presence — from one place." |
| SEO | "Rank higher with tools that make SEO simple." |
| Outreach | "Find leads, build links, grow your reach — automatically." |
| Bots | "AI chatbots for WhatsApp and Telegram. Your business never sleeps." |

## 9. Go-To-Market

### Launch Order
1. **Master brand page (bapita.com)** — build first, establishes the suite
2. **Book.bapita.com** — already live, redirect existing traffic from bapita.com
3. **Social.bapita.com** — next build (in dev now)
4. **SEO, Outreach, Bots** — sequential launches with waitlist capture from day 1

### Launch Strategy
- Master page goes live → shows all 5 products with "Coming soon" badges
- Book traffic redirects naturally to book.bapita.com
- Book dashboard gets a "Check out Bapita Social →" cross-sell banner
- Waitlist capture for each upcoming product builds anticipation
- Each product launch gets its own Product Hunt + directory submissions push

### Cross-Sell Strategy
Each product's dashboard shows companion products:
- Book dashboard: "Run your social too? Try Bapita Social."
- Social dashboard: "Need more bookings? Use Bapita Book."
- SEO dashboard: "Ranking content needs links. Try Outreach."

---

## 10. Open Decisions & Questions

### To Resolve
- [ ] Exact per-product pricing (free tier? trial length?)
- [ ] Social launch date (when is it ready for production?)
- [ ] Domain migration plan for book.bapita.com (what happens to existing bapita.com URLs?)
- [ ] Logo v3 — keep current wordmark? lockup change for suite identity?
- [ ] Illustration style — create custom set for each product or use abstract icons?
- [ ] Hebrew version timeline — when to add RTL support?
- [ ] Monorepo vs separate repos per product?
- [ ] Shared auth system across products (single sign-on?) or separate?

### Document Version
- **Created:** June 29, 2026
- **Author:** Planning session — brand direction, product architecture, visual identity
- **Based on:** bapita-brand-doc.md v2 + multi-product strategy discussions
- **Supersedes:** v2 brand doc (booking-only positioning is now historical)
